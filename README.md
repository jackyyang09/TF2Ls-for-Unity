# Overview
TF2Ls for Unity (or TF2 Libraries/Loaders for Unity) is a collection of editor tools that help streamline the porting and usage of Valve assets in the development of Unity games.

This set of tools is a collection of existing scripts from past community developers packed together and given a very friendly user interface. Things that required too many mouse clicks, minutes, and headaches can now be done in seconds!

# What's Included
* TF2 Shaders that support Painting and translucency
* A mesh skeleton switcher that allows for the easy parenting of item/cosmetic/weapon rigs to character skeletal meshes
* A model texturing tool that automatically reads .VMT files, generates new material assets, converts associated .VTFs into .TGAs and finally applies them to a mesh. All in one press!

# Credits
* VTF import functionality is done in the backend using VTFLib [Neil "Jed" Jedrzejewski](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/User:Wunderboy) and [Ryan "Nemesis" Gregg](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/User:Nem) under the GPL and LGPL licenses.
* VMT parsing is done using scripts from [Frassle's Ibasa](https://github.com/Frassle/Ibasa) library under the MIT license.
* TF2 shaders are implementations of those found floating around the Unity forums that were then modified by me to add paint support.
